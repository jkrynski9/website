		<h3>"Marisa" (current)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Current main, build partially on previous PC (case, HDD stayed)</li>

			</ul>
		<h3>"Marisa" (depreciated)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Previous main PC, mostly from parts I got from a friend.</li>
				<li>Intel Core i5-2400, 16GB of RAM.</li>
				<li>GPU is the weakest part, AMD Radeon HD 6770 with 1GB of VRAM.</li>

			</ul>
		<h3>Lenovo Moto G8 Plus (depreciated)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Previous main phone, Android 9 (waiting for 10). The screen resolution is kinda weird, mostly because notch and stuff.</li>
				<li>4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage + 128GB microSD card for all my music.</li>
				<li>It got a really nice 48MP (effective 12MP) camera, doing pretty nice looking shots with it.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Nokia 6 (depreciated)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>My (previous) new main phone, Android 9 (was 8.1). It's so awesome, and this fingerprint scanner is quite comfy.</li>

				<li>32GB of internal storage, no need for MicroSD now.</li>
			</ul>

				<li><a href="wiigames.html">Games list.</a></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Newest addition to the collection, got the v2 model (non-OLED) at the good price I would say, considering all accessories included and not much wear on it.</li>
				<li>It's interesting to have a current generation console, I'm planning to get some of the previously released games as well as look for interesting new releases (hopefully as little digital as possible).</li>
				<li><a href="nswgames.html">Games list.</a></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Nintendo DS Lite</h3>

				<li><a href="dsgames.html">Games list.</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Nintendo GameBoy Micro</h3>

				<li><a href="gbmgames.html">Games list.</a></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Playstation Vita</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Bought rather cheap last year, OLED model that had a low battery cycle count and came with SD2Vita already installed in the slot.</li>
				<li>Modded for emulation (PS1/PSP through Adrenaline, some other consoles through RetroArch). Really nice hidden games for the system too, which was kinda unexpected.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Gameboy</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The famous DMG brick, found it for sale on a convention for a rather nice price.</li>
				<li>All buttons work perfectly, nothing is missing and it looks like it wasn't used at all in those 30 years (probably restored by previous owner).</li>
				<li><a href="gbgames.html">Games list.</a></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Gameboy Color</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>GBC I got from my friend recently.</li>

			</ul>
		<h2>Audio stuff</h2>
		<h3>iPod Classic 5.5gen</h3>

			</ul>
		<h3>SanDisk Sansa Clip+</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Thrift store find, perfect condition with a really good price for this DAP</li>
				<li>Some German used it, and it came with some killer tracks like Bangarang</li>
				<li>Rockboxed, it had the 128GB microSD put in but I had freezes on playback so it's not used right now.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Sony Walkman WM-EX382</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Compact cassette portable I got, bought at the end of 2023</li>
				<li>Serviced by previous owner, new belt etc. Sadly one screw is now stripped.</li>
				<li>I love cassettes (other kinds of physical media too), it's nice to have a portable player for them (now I need a solid home player and a recorder).</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
		<h3>HP Jornada 520</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Pocket PC, I need a memory card for it.</li>
				<li>SH3 processor, 16MB of storage. Got a CF card for it but currently no way to put any software on it (no serial cable, no way to put software directly on the CF card).</li>
				<li>Windows CE 3.0</li>
